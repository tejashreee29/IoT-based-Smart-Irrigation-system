# IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System

An IoT-based Smart Irrigation system designed to automate watering for gardens or crops. The system uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor soil dryness and controls a water pump automatically, ensuring efficient water usage and healthy plants.

## Features

- Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Uses a sensor to detect soil dryness. Water pump automatically turns on when moisture is below a set threshold.  
- Automated Irrigation**: Reduces water wastage and prevents overwatering.  
- Simple Control**: Managed through Arduino IDE, making setup and monitoring easy.  
- Portable & Scalable**: Suitable for small-scale agriculture or home gardens.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Mega  
- Relay Module  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Jumper Wires  
- USB Cable (for connecting Arduino to laptop)  
- Battery (for power supply)  

## Software

- Arduino IDE (to program and control the Arduino)  
- Sketch runs the relay to control the water pump based on moisture readings
